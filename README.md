Surfs Up

Overview of Analysis
Thus far, W. Avy likes our analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. In this report, we will present our weather analysis to show temperature trends during summer and winter months.

Results
From annual temperature data, results are extracted for the months of June and December

Temperature Statistics

June avg temp - 74.9°F / December avg temp - 71.0°F
Similar averages indicate the temperatures in Oahu stay relatively steady in the 70's year round

June min temp - 64.0°F / December min temp - 56.0°F
June's lows still provide good surfing and ice cream weather as December's lows could show less opportunities for both surfing and ice cream

June 75th percentile - 77°F / December 75th percentile - 74°F
Indicates 75% of the time the temperature is in the middle to upper 70's

Analysis
As seen in figures below for temperature and precipitation. As Hawaii has temp same whole year so its hard to point out difference Number of data points are more in June than December.

Mean temperature/precipitaition for all the years from 2010 to 2017 is almost same for both December and June.

Maximum temperature is for both month of December and June is between 70-75 degrees.

Analysis
It is clear that there are seasonal differences of rainfall between months.
Also worth to note that 3rd quartile stats of both months show similarity of .12 and .15 inches.
So in summary of the 2 months, most rainfall amount are similar, but on extreme days there are notable differences in the amount of rain as well.

Summary
By looking at the results, opening a surf shop seems like a smart investment. The average temperature in two extreme months of the year (June and December) seem similar. For most months of the year, the temperature will be good for surfing and thus, for a surf shop.

To dive a little deeper, we looked at the percipitation levels through the two months as well. The major takeaways from this analysis are:
The average percipitation is 0.136 inches per day in June
The average percipitation is 0.217 inches per day in December
50% of days in June have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation
50% of days in December have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation
The maximum percipitation is 4.43 inches on a single day in June
The maximum percipitation is 6.42 inches on a single day in December


Summary
Additional analysis could help solidify the business case.

Query to view precipitation statistics during June and December
This would show the relationship between temperatures and precipitation

Query to view average temperatures and precipitation levels at different stations
This could help narrow down the optimal location for the shop


Limitation of Analysis and Recommendation
The data is trusted as is, and is assumed to be accurate.
Time of day when rain occurs is not available, only daily rain totals.
I recommend we obtain further data on hours of rain occurrence, then filter and understand rain pattern during business hours.
Additionally, with the existing data set, we can start on examining how many consecutive rainy days break down month by month. The result may help decide if certain months the business should simply close and let us take a break or vacation.
Lastly, we should examine all the months and its outliers in rainfall, as these can be indicative of severe weather events.
